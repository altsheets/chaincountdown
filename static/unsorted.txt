new image idea when I read this:
"Only 77K NXT worth of the TVE asset remaining!"
https://sprnt.slack.com/archives/general/p1439228846009774

code:
A=getAsset(asset) 
--> T=asset.quantity
--> I=getAccount(Issuer) 
----> B=I.assetbalance(asset)

create image: "asset.name (asset.id) is sold to 100*(T-B)/T percent"  

bamm!

Now mozarello cooking from "Use-Before-Long-Ago"-date, because that was price-reduced in the shop 
poverty is fun, too! :-)

You were indeed. The thing above is a snippet that went into my "unsorted.txt" collection. 
The idea is to have s.th. like my "chaincountdown", but for unsold assets. If it were ready now,
you could put it on your webpage, or even post the link into this slack - and each time s.o.
buys more TVE, and thus your balance decreases - that image would change, by itself.

Anyways, thanks for the inspiration - and congrats to your 85% success already. Well done!
